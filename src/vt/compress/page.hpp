 *
 * A compressed terminal page which retains its resident virtual mapping.
 *
 * Terminal pages have two kinds of state: the large `Page.memory` allocation
 * and a comparatively small `Page` value containing offsets, dimensions,
 * dirty state, and allocator metadata. Not all of the latter state lives in
 * the backing memory, so preserving only the memory bytes is insufficient.
 * We preserve the complete `Page` value instead. This follows the same model
 * as `Page.cloneBuf`: page internals use offsets, so a shallow page copy remains
 * valid when its memory contents are restored at the same address.
 *
 * The resident memory is deliberately not freed by this type. `PageList`
 * keeps the virtual range allocated while asking the operating system to
 * discard its physical pages. Keeping the range has two useful properties:
 * the embedded page never contains a dangling pointer, and restoring the page
 * does not require a fallible allocation.
 *
 * The intended state transition is:
 *
 * 1. Create this value while the source page is resident.
 * 2. Ask the OS to decommit the source page's memory.
 * 3. Replace the PageList node's resident state with this value.
 * 4. To restore, recommit the retained range and call `restore`.
 * 5. After committing the resident state, call `deinit` to free the encoded
 *    bytes.
 *
 * If decommit is unavailable or fails, the caller should deinitialize the
 * compressed candidate and leave the source page resident. This type does not
 * perform any virtual-memory operations itself.
 *
 * The planned native implementation uses `MADV_DONTNEED` on Linux and pairs
 * `MADV_FREE_REUSABLE` with `MADV_FREE_REUSE` on Darwin. Targets without a
 * reliable retained-mapping decommit operation should leave page compression
 * disabled rather than free and later reallocate the resident memory.
 *
 * TRANSLITERATION. Comments are upstream's unless marked "Wisp:".
 * Wisp: the allocator is the C heap. `alloc` keeps upstream's two-word
 * std.mem.Allocator slot so the representation overhead, and therefore
 * which pages are worth compressing, matches upstream. Valgrind hooks are
 * omitted (no Valgrind on Windows).
