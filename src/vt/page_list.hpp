     * identifies or whether that coordinate is still in range. Examples include
     * rotating rows after an erase, truncating a page's row range, reinitializing
     * the sole remaining page, or shortening the source page of a split. Without
     * a new generation, a cached pointer, serial, and coordinate could still pass
     * `nodeIsValid` while referring to a different row than it originally did.
     * Screen and Terminal fast paths which manipulate Page rows directly must use
     * this because they bypass PageList's own row-mutation helpers.
     *
     * The caller must pass a node which is currently live in this PageList. Call
     * this at the point the operation commits to changing the layout and before
     * the first such change. When an operation is intended to be atomic, finish
     * its failable preparation first so a failed operation does not needlessly
     * invalidate references. One call per affected node is sufficient when an
     * operation performs several layout changes without exposing intermediate
     * references.
     *
     * This helper is only needed for in-place changes. Removing or replacing a
     * node already invalidates old references through the live-list check in
     * `nodeIsValid`, and newly allocated or reused nodes receive a fresh serial as
     * part of their initialization. Ordinary cell or style changes which preserve
     * the meaning of page coordinates do not require a new generation solely for
     * that reason.
     *
     * The only state changed here is `node.serial` and the next-generation counter
     * `page_serial`. Consequently, every previously captured pointer-plus-serial
     * pair for this node becomes invalid while new references can capture the new
     * generation. This does not advance `page_serial_epoch`: only `reset` starts a
     * new whole-list validity epoch.
     *
     * This also does not mutate the page, update tracked pins or viewport state,
     * adjust row or memory accounting, mark cells dirty, or notify incremental
     * compression. The surrounding operation remains responsible for all such
     * bookkeeping required by its layout change. */
