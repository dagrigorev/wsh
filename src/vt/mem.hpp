 * Virtual-memory operations shared by terminal page owners.
 *
 * Terminal pages use page-aligned, page-multiple mappings. This module can
 * discard the physical pages behind one of those mappings without releasing
 * its virtual address range, then prepare the same range for reuse. It does
 * not allocate memory or decide which terminal pages should be discarded.
 *
 * Decommit releases physical pages only. The address range and its memory
 * accounting (the Linux VMA, the Windows commit charge) stay with the
 * process, so a read after decommit returns zeros or the old contents rather
 * than faulting, and recommit has nothing to acquire that could fail.
 *
 * TRANSLITERATION. Comments are upstream's unless marked "Wisp:". Only the
 * Windows and test-build paths are carried over (this is a Windows port).
