 * A screen: the pages, and the cursor moving over them.
 *
 * PageList holds the text and knows nothing about where anyone is looking at
 * it. A Screen adds the cursor — where the next character goes — and the
 * operations that move it. That sounds small, and the struct is small, but it
 * is where two things that have been kept apart so far finally meet: a
 * position on the screen, which is a column and a row counted from the top of
 * what is displayed, and a position in the text, which is a pin.
 *
 * The cursor is both, and keeping them agreeing is most of this file. The
 * screen coordinates are what a terminal program means by the cursor and what
 * every escape sequence is written in terms of. The pin is what survives the
 * pages changing underneath it. Neither can be dropped: coordinates alone
 * would be wrong after a reflow, and a pin alone cannot answer "what column
 * am I in" without a walk.
 *
 * NOT THE LIVE SCREEN. src/terminal/screen.h is Wisp's working terminal
 * buffer, which is what the application currently runs on. This is the ported
 * one, built on the ported page list, and the two are unrelated for now.
 *
 * PARTIAL PORT. The screen, the cursor, its movement, writing text, erasing,
 * selections and the saved cursor are here. Upstream's remaining pieces are
 * not, so the ledger records Screen.zig as `wip`.
 *
 * The alternate screen is not one of them: upstream a terminal owns two
 * screens and swaps between them, so it arrives with Terminal rather than
 * here.
