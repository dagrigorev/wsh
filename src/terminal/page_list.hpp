 *
 * The list of pages that makes up a terminal's screen and its scrollback.
 *
 * A Page is a fixed allocation: it holds a set number of rows and a bounded
 * amount of style, grapheme and link storage, and it cannot be extended. That
 * is what makes a page cheap — everything inside it is addressed by offsets
 * into one block, so a page can be moved, copied or written to disk whole.
 * The cost is that a page fills up, and the last three page operations all
 * ended at the same place: when a page runs out, something has to hand out a
 * new one. This is that something.
 *
 * Pages are kept in a doubly linked list, oldest first. Text scrolling off the
 * screen does not move: it stays in the page it was written to, and the screen
 * is simply a window onto the last rows of the list. Scrollback is therefore
 * not a separate structure to copy into — it is the pages nobody is looking at
 * any more, and forgetting it is freeing the page at the front.
 *
 * PARTIAL PORT. The list itself, page allocation, growth and trimming, pins
 * and tracked pins, the viewport, scrolling, resizing, page replacement and
 * splitting are here. Upstream's remaining pieces are not, so the ledger
 * still records PageList.zig as `wip`.
