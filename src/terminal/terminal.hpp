 * The terminal: the thing a program is actually talking to.
 *
 * A Screen is a buffer with a cursor over it, and it has no opinions. It does
 * not know that a line feed is different from moving down, that a tab goes to
 * the next tab stop, or that DECAWM exists. Those are properties of a
 * terminal — of the machine being emulated — and this is where they live.
 *
 * Two things arrive here that nothing below could hold:
 *
 * The modes. A terminal's behaviour is settable by escape sequence, and a
 * mode is not state about the text but state about what the next character
 * will do to it. auto_wrap has been sitting on Screen since writing text was
 * ported, with a note saying it belonged here; this is where it moves to, and
 * the Screen's copy becomes something Terminal keeps in step rather than
 * something anyone else sets.
 *
 * The second screen. A terminal owns two: the primary one, with its
 * scrollback, and the alternate one that full-screen programs draw on. They
 * are the same kind of thing, which is why a Screen has no idea there is
 * another — swapping between them is the terminal's business.
 *
 * NOT THE LIVE TERMINAL. Wisp's working emulator is the C code under
 * src/terminal. This is the ported one, built on the ported screen, and
 * nothing runs on it yet.
 *
 * PARTIAL PORT. The terminal, its modes, both screens, printing, the C0
 * control characters, tab stops, scroll regions and the insert and delete
 * operations are here. The character sets, the rest of the modes and the
 * escape sequence dispatch are not, so the ledger records Terminal.zig as
 * `wip`.
