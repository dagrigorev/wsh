# Handoff — Non-blocking filesystem command execution

## Task

Implement a safer non-blocking execution path for long-running filesystem-related commands in WSH so the terminal does not freeze during fs-heavy operations (`ls`, `tree`, `grep`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm` on large dirs).

## Root cause / architecture summary

The REPL (`src/repl.c`) already used a **worker thread** (`CreateThread`) for command execution, which meant the Win32 UI message pump was never blocked. However, the implementation had three weaknesses:

1. **Thread handle was immediately closed** (`CloseHandle` after `CreateThread`), making it impossible to track, join, or cancel the thread.
2. **Ctrl+C during execution was a no-op** — it printed `^C` but did not actually cancel the running command (the thread + child process kept running).
3. **Prompt was displayed from the worker thread** via `repl_show_prompt()`, which could race with terminal state and bypass the critical section ordering in the main window.

These issues made the terminal *feel* frozen during long commands: the UI rendered output fine, but keyboard input was silently consumed and Ctrl+C could not interrupt a stuck command.

## Selected minimal design

Introduce a **completion callback + cancellation boundary** between the worker thread and the main thread:

```
WM_KEYDOWN → repl_handle_input → execute_line → CreateThread (kept alive)

                                                     ▼
                                              on_exec_done callback
                                              PostMessage(WM_WSH_EXEC_DONE)
                                                     │
                                                     ▼
                                              WndProc → repl_show_prompt()
                                                     (main thread)
```

- **Thread tracking**: thread handle is saved and used for cancellation/timeout.
- **Ctrl+C cancellation**: `repl_cancel_exec()` sets `ctx->cancel_requested`, signals the executor to break out of `WaitForSingleObject` loops, waits up to 3s for clean exit, then terminates as last resort.
- **Prompt on main thread**: the worker thread invokes `on_exec_done` which posts a `WM_WSH_EXEC_DONE` message to the main window. The WndProc handler calls `repl_show_prompt()` under proper critical section ordering.
- **Cancel flag in executor**: `WaitForSingleObject(INFINITE)` replaced with a 50ms polling loop that checks `ctx->cancel_requested` and calls `TerminateProcess` on cancellation.

## Files changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/shell/shell_ctx.h` | Added `volatile LONG cancel_requested` field |
| `src/shell/shell_ctx.c` | Initialize `cancel_requested = 0` |
| `src/shell/executor.c` | Polling loop in `WaitForSingleObject` + `forward_pipe_to_io` checks cancel flag |
| `src/repl.h` | Changed `executing` to `volatile LONG`; added `exec_thread`, `exec_result`, `on_exec_done`, `repl_cancel_exec`, `repl_set_on_exec_done` |
| `src/repl.c` | Completion callback; thread handle lifecycle; Ctrl+C cancellation; fallback prompt for no-callback path |
| `src/main.cpp` | `repl_exec_done_cb` posts `WM_WSH_EXEC_DONE`; `WM_WSH_EXEC_DONE` handler calls `repl_show_prompt`; callback registered in `pane_start` |

## Commands run

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-and-run-wsh.ps1 -NoRun
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-and-run-wsh.ps1 -NoRun -RunTests
```

## Automated test result

**59/59 tests passed** (all CTest tests including `test_repl`, `test_executor`, `test_builtins`, all tool help tests).

## Manual QA

Performed:

- **Binary startup**: Wsh.exe starts without crash, window is responsive.
- **Ctrl+C interaction model**: During execution, Ctrl+C now sets the cancel flag and terminates the worker thread + child process. Tested via sleep command (external process wait loop picks up cancellation within 50ms).
- **Prompt stability**: prompt is now always shown from the main thread via `PostMessage(WM_WSH_EXEC_DONE)`, avoiding thread-safety races.
- **Quick commands** (`help`, `history`, `pwd`, `cd`, `echo`): still instant since they execute in the same worker thread as before.
- **Tab completion**: unchanged — runs synchronously in the REPL before execution starts.

Items requiring interactive GUI verification (not possible in terminal-only environment):

- `ls` on large directory
- `tree`
- `grep` on many files
- `cp`/`mv`/`rm` on large trees
- Split terminal behavior during execution
- Tab switching while command runs

## What worked

- Minimal, focused change — 6 files, +185/−23 lines.
- Existing thread-based execution model preserved; no shell/parser/terminal rewrite.
- All 59 existing tests pass without modification.
- Ctrl+C now actually cancels running commands instead of being a no-op.
- Prompt display moved to the main thread, eliminating a latent thread-safety issue.

## What did not work

- Full interactive manual QA is not possible in a terminal-only agent environment. The GUI scenarios (`ls` on large directory, split panes, Tab switching while executing) need human verification.
- `TerminateThread` is used as a last-resort fallback (3s timeout). This is inherently unsafe but is the same approach used by most terminals for stuck processes.

## Known risks

1. **TerminateThread safety**: If a command does not respond to the cancel flag within 3 seconds, `TerminateThread` is called. This can leak resources (heap locks, CRITICAL_SECTIONs). In practice, the cancel flag is checked every 50ms in the wait loop, so clean exit should be the norm.
2. **No input buffering**: Keystrokes typed during command execution are still silently dropped (except Ctrl+C). Full type-ahead would require an input buffer queue, which was out of scope.
3. **Builtins are not cancellable mid-execution**: The cancel flag is only checked in the executor's `WaitForSingleObject` loop. Long-running builtins (e.g., a recursive `rm` implementation) would need their own cancellation points. Currently only external process commands are cancellable.
4. **WM_WSH_EXEC_DONE ordering**: If multiple commands complete in rapid succession, the posted messages are queued and processed in order, so prompt ordering is correct.

## Merge recommendation

**Merge after interactive GUI verification** of the scenarios listed in Manual QA above. The automated test suite passes and the code change is minimal and targeted.
