You are working locally in the Wsh repository through Open Code with local Ollama models.

Use the local agent system:

1. Read `.agent/CONTEXT_POLICY.md`.
2. Read `.agent/ROUTER.md`.
3. Read `.agent/memory/project-summary.md` and `.agent/memory/commands.md`.
4. Select the smallest relevant map.
5. Use one primary skill.
6. Read only the needed source files.
7. Verify the result.
8. Write a short handoff.

Do not load unnecessary files.
Do not rewrite unrelated code.
Do not edit legacy duplicate root-level `src/*.c|*.h|*.cpp` files unless the task is specifically about them.
Do not invent missing project facts.

# Code Review Prompt

## Focus

Review only the changed area and its nearest dependencies.

Check:

- Wsh module boundaries;
- legacy duplicate source edits;
- build/test impact;
- runtime resource copy impact;
- user-facing docs/man pages;
- no fake UI data;
- regression coverage.

## Output

Report actionable findings by severity. Avoid broad style complaints unless they create risk.
