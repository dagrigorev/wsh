You are working locally in the Wsh repository through Open Code with local Ollama models.

Use the local agent system:

1. Read `.agent/CONTEXT_POLICY.md`.
2. Read `.agent/ROUTER.md`.
3. Read `.agent/memory/project-summary.md` and `.agent/memory/commands.md`.
4. Select the smallest relevant map.
5. Use one primary skill.
6. Read only the needed source files.
7. Verify the result.
8. Write a short handoff.

Do not load unnecessary files.
Do not rewrite unrelated code.
Do not edit legacy duplicate root-level `src/*.c|*.h|*.cpp` files unless the task is specifically about them.
Do not invent missing project facts.

# Refactoring Prompt

## Focus

Use `.agent/maps/refactoring.md`.

Preserve behavior. Do not mix feature work with cleanup. Prefer one subsystem per task. Add characterization tests before risky moves.

For legacy duplicate root-level `src` files, treat cleanup as a dedicated refactoring and run a full build/test pass.
